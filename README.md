Conveyor. You will sweet sleeping while the script will workin for you. It changes the input file, saves the result of each numerical simulation and starts a new simulation with other parameters by it-self.

Let me introduce to you the variant with LAMMPS conveyor (see the path).

**VERY IMPORTANT:** 
PowerShell as default don't let you run scripts if you are not a server. You should or change security settings about this 
or write in code that this time you allow scripts. You could open `cmd` and insert command:

`powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File script.ps1 `
this will allow to run script this time. (It more safely tnan cange 
secure policy.)
